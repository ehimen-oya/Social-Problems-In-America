    <h1>Black people have always had it tough in America.</h1>
<br>
    <ul>
<li>Slavery:
Africans were brought from their
home countries to work for white
men for no pay at all. Slaves in 
the US built many prominent buildings,
including but not limited to the White
House, the Capital Building, and many
buildings at the University of Virginia.</li>
<li>Surpression:
After slavery was aboished in the US,
black people were still not equal to
white men. In the Constitution, black
men were considered 3/5 of a man. Black
people weren't allowed to do everything
that white people could.
</li>
<li>Modern Day:
Today, African Americans are still at
a disadvantage to white people. African
Americans are having historically bad
interactions with the law right now. They
are also at a disadvantage when it comes
to getting jobs and making schools.
