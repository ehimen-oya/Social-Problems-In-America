    <h1>Natvie Americans have always had a tense relationship with Americans.</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>European Travelers:
When travelers like Christopher Columbus
came over from Europe, they only brought
suffering to the Natives. The European
carried dieases that they were immune to,
but the Natives weren't and lots of them
died. And some of the ones that weren't
killed by the dieases were brought back
to Europe as slaves.
</li>
        <li>Invasion of Land:
When the British came from England, they
found people already living there, the
Native Americans. The natives helped the
settlers, but were eventually forced west
by the settlers.
</li>
        <li>Modern Day:
Today in America, people are trying to
do more to recgonize the people who were
on this land before them. But some people
still make insenstive comment about people
of Native American backgrounds. One example
of this is Donald Trump calling Elizabeth
Warren Pocahontas and Sacagawea.
