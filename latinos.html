    <h1>America has always had problems dealing with Spanish people in the country.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Settlements:
The Spaniards were some of the first people
 to inhabit America.  Juan Ponce de Leon
 found the coast of Florida in 1521 and Pedro
 Menendez de Aviles later founded the  oldest
 inhabited community in America St. Agustine
 in Florida in the name of Spain.
        </li>
        <li>War:
While the Americans settled on the East Coast,
the Spaniards owned a lot of the land to the
West. When the Americans bought Louisiana, they
found the Spaniards' land, and later they
went to war for it. Long story short, America
won the land that includes Clifornia and
Texas.
        </li>Modern Day:
The latinos in today's America are greatly
sterotyped by the government and have been
abused. They have been deported in great
numbers and have been seperated from thier
families. But there is also a great number
of latinos still in America. They make up
18% of the US population between 2010 and
2019. That is the second largest in America.
