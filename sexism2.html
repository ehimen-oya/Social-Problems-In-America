    <h1>Woman have been at a disadvantage in America since the beggining.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
During the early years of this country, women
were not entitled to the same rights and privileges as men.
Woman often had to give up thier few rights to thier husbands
after thier marriage. They couldn't own land, they didn't get
the same education as men, and they couldn't get the same jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
State laws were passed in the 1800s which allowed women to
retain their property after marriage. Also, the first women's
rights convention was held in the 1800s. Many who supported
women's rights became active in the abolitionist movement
during the Civil War era. Some even became well-known public
orators, an uncommon occupation for women at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
In 1869, the Wyoming Territory passed a law which allowed
women to vote and serve on juries. Several other western
territories and states subsequently granted women the right
to vote. Women's rights advocates were outraged that the
Fifteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1870, prohibited
the states from denying voting rights on the ground of race,
but not on the basis of sex. In 1878, Congress considered a
Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote.
Although the amendment failed, it was revitalized every year
for a period of 40 years.
        </li>
        <li>
Congress passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibits
employers from discriminating against employees on the ground
of sex with respect to the terms of compensation. The following
year, Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which bans discrimination in employment on the basis of sex, among
other grounds.
        </li>
        <li>
In 1972, Congress submitted the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the
states for ratification. Basically, the ERA barred all discrimination
on the ground of sex. However, the ERA suffered defeat after the
necessary number of states failed to ratify it within the mandatory
ten-year deadline. To date, women are still struggling with the issue
of equality in their personal and professional relationships. Thirty
-five years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women have still
not achieved equality in wages.
